# Future Tools (project ideas)

Future Tools (project ideas)

This section includes a list of tools we would like to create for use in competitions such as CCDC. These also are here to act as project recommendations for anyone looking for ideas.

* A tool to hash important files on linux or windows systems and save those to a .txt file, compare the origonal hashes and filenames to future runs.
* A tool that uses pe-siev ([https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve)) to automatically check processes on a system, then give options on what to do based on the results. (windows)
