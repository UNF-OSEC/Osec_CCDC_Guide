# Intro

The purpose of this guide is to provide an organized knowledge base and guide for the UNF OSEC club to use for the CCDC Competition.

**This Guide Is Not Designed For Working Systems, Only Competition Ones** despite this it may still be useful as refrence for system administration and defense.

These notes are not all encompassing and should be used as refrence rather than as a direct guide to use in the competition.

I encourage you all to create your own "cheatsheet" based on these notes, and practice doing the tasks they cover in virtual machines and simulated networks.

The intention of this documentation is that it becomes a living knowledge base for the club, that sections are added to and updated as new stratigies for securing systems for competition become known.
