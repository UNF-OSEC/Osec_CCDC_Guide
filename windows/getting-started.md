# Getting Started

Windows is the most common opperating system for every day use. While many of the core principals to securing it are the same as those in linux there are some major differences on how to implament these principals.

Instead of SUDO windows systems use admin. If you need to use admin permissions you must start the program or service you wish to use with them.

An example of how to start an instance of powershell with admin perms from within the terminal:\
`Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs`

In a GUI windows enviroment you can rightclick a program or service and select the run as administrator option.

***

For this section any usage of the terminal will be with Powershell unless otherwise stated
