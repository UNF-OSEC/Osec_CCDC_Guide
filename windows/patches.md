# Patches

Often systems that you are tasked with defending may be out of date. These old versions of system services and programs may just have issues or new features added, but they can also include vulnerabilities that had been patched already and can be easily fixed on your system.

The most common way these Windows patches are distributed are through Windows Updates. It is however possiable to manually install patches on windows systems.

To find updates to apply manually go to the following site. [https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx) Here you can find microsoft updates by searching in the search field that you can manually download and install.
