# Task Manager

The Windows task manager is the most basic tool that can be used to easily see what is active on a system. It will list active tasks, as well as some system statistics and Application History, User Information, and which applications will run at startup.

From this you can kill System Processes by right clicking the process you wish to kill in the **Processes** tab and selecting `End Task` .

In the **Startup** Tab you can view which programms on the system automatically run at startup. You can select a program by right clicking it on the list and toggle weather it should or should not start automatically on system startup.

The **Users** tab allows you to see which processes each individual user has active.

The **Details** tab gives a brief overview of each process.

The **Services** tab gives a brief overview of the services running on the system.
