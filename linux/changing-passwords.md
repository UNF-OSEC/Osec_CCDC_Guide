# Changing Passwords

This is one of the first things you should do when accessing a competition machine is change the passwords.

**PASSWORDS SHOULD BE CYCLED AT REGULAR INTERVALS**

To change your current users password:\
`passwd`\
To change the password of another user as root:\
`passwd <username>`

One useful way of keeping track of passwords being used on each system, and limiting the red teams ability to spy on them is to mark them on a pre-made list of passwords, and crossing them off after they are cycled to prevent reuse
